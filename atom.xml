The first post served by Antwar. I hope there will be many more. I hope that there are more people out there that want a simple and friendly blogging tool. Because that's what we are trying to build.</p>
<p>The project started out as a fork of Brad Denver's experiment <a href="http://braddenver.com/blog/2015/react-static-site.html">react-static-site</a>. We have come quite a long way already and we want to keep improving Antwar.</p>
<p>We would be happy if you wanted to try Antwar and give some feedback.</p>
